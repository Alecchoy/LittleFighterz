ONE PIECE LITTLE FIGHTER READ ME

BACKGROUND

I am creating this fighting game off of my passion for a masterpiece called One Piece. This game is a 2D fighter game where a player can move on a plane in order to attack, and dodge enemies.
Different characters will different ranges of abilities such as sword extenstions or projectile objects. I will be using a lot of object collision in this project. The rendering will be creating using sprites. The goal of the the player is to traverse across the maps to defeat different enemies. You will spawn from the left side and try to go to the right side in order to finish the stage before moving on to the next stage.

In One Piece Little fighter, users will be able to:

+ Access a start-up page with instructions on how to play the game, start the game, and select a character.
+ Control a player to fight other players using abilities and basic attacks that will damage the enemy when the enemies hit box comes in contact with the players attack animations.
+ Will be placed on a top down view plane which allows the user to move up, down, left, and right on the plane and also jump in place.
+ Users will be able to use special abilities which increase their range or emit a projectile to damage or even knock back the target.

In addition, this project will include:

+ Players will have individual sprite animations that fit the character and its abilities.
+ The map will also require sprites to move across the board in order to defeat the enemies coming in from the right side and clearing the stage. 
+ The map and background will both be moving

Technologies, Libaries, APIs

+ I will be using the Canvas API to render most of my functionality within the game.
