# One Piece Little Fighters


One Piece Little Fighterz is a 2D fighter game where players can move on a canvas plane in order to attack, and dodge their opponent inspired by a modern epic named One Piece.




## How it works

Different characters will different ranges of abilities such as sword extenstions or projectile objects. I will be using a lot of object collision in this project. The rendering will be creating using sprites. The goal of the the player is to traverse across the maps to defeat different enemies. You will spawn from the left side and try to go to the right side in order to finish the stage before moving on to the next stage.

## In One Piece Little fighter, users will be able to:

- Access a start-up page with instructions on how to play the game, start the game, and select a character.
- Control a player to fight other players using abilities and basic attacks that will damage the enemy when the enemies hit box comes in contact with the players attack animations.
- Will be placed on a top down view plane which allows the user to move up, down, left, and right on the plane and also jump in place.
- Players will have individual sprite animations that fit the character and its abilities. 


## Technologies, Libaries, APIs

- Canvas API to render most of my video layers and sprites.
- Webpack and babel to bundle and transpile the vanilla javscript.
- Event listeners to track user input and translate them into actions for the charadter.
- One Piece sprite library in order to get animations for each character.
